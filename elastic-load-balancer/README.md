# Elastic Load Balancer - ELB

## Load Balancing

- Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers downstream.

## Why use a load balancer?

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances

- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to the application

- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances

- Do regular health checks to your instances

- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites

- Enforce stickness with cookies

- High availability across zones

- Separate public traffic from private traffic
